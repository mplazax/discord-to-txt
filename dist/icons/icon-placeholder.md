# Extension Icons Placeholder

For a production extension, you should replace these placeholder instructions with actual icon files:

- icon16.png (16×16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32×32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48×48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128×128 pixels)

## How to Create Icons

1. Design a simple, recognizable icon that represents your Discord Conversation Exporter extension.
2. Create it in the sizes listed above.
3. Save them in PNG format with transparent backgrounds.
4. Place them in this directory (`src/icons/`).

## Recommended Icon Content

A good icon for this extension might include:

- Discord logo or color theme (blurple)

Remember to respect Discord's brand guidelines and trademarks if using their logo or styling.
